## Features

- **Endpoint Manager** — Add, edit, activate/deactivate, and delete API endpoints with support for `None`, `Bearer`, `API Key`, and `Basic` authentication
- **Dynamic Path Variables** — Automatically orchestrate mass API fetching by injecting variables (like `{id}`) into URLs from another MongoDB collection's fields.
- **Custom Collections** — Store fetched data in a central `data_records` collection or automatically route it to dedicated custom collections.
- **Field Mappings** — Map and transform response fields (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`) to a unified schema
- **One-click Fetch** — Pull data from a single endpoint or all active endpoints at once, with robust background fault tolerance and error skipping.
- **Cancellable & Resumable Sync** — Safely cancel active data syncs without corrupting data. Progress states (like `partial`) are stored persistently and seamlessly resume on refresh.
- **Ultra-Fast Database Insertion** — Automatically batches operations into memory and leverages MongoDB's `bulkWrite` API to insert thousands of records simultaneously at absolute maximum wire speed.
- **Data Browser** — Paginated table/grid view with date range filters, endpoint filtering, and full-text search.
- **Fetch Logs** — Complete history of every fetch operation with status, record counts, duration, and errors. Includes granular deletion and "Clear All" features to manage history.
- **Live Terminal Logs** — Real-time, streaming terminal view of your background Sync Engine operations, just like deployment logs, with auto-scrolling and log size monitoring.
- **High-Performance Dashboard** — Live stats cached directly on endpoint documents for instantaneous rendering of total records, active endpoints, and distributions.
- **Export** — Download current view as JSON or CSV
- **Mobile Responsive** — Fully optimized UI with sidebar overlays and responsive grids for managing data on the go.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Three-tier permission system (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`) utilizing bcrypt password hashing. Includes granular, per-user page restrictions (e.g., blocking access to Endpoints, Fetch Data, Data Browser, or Fetch Logs).
- **Zero-Config Dynamic JWT Manager** — The backend utilizes the `jose` library to automatically generate a secure cryptographic secret, export it as a JWK (JSON Web Key), and persist it securely in MongoDB. No need to manage or configure a `JWT_SECRET` environment variable!
- **Dynamic Session Timeout** — Admins can change the global session expiration time directly from the "System Security" panel in the UI (e.g., `30m` for 30 minutes, `12h` for 12 hours, `7d` for 7 days).
- **Session Hijacking Prevention** — JWT tokens are cryptographically fingerprinted using a hash of the user's IP Address and Browser User-Agent. Stolen or forged session tokens will instantly be invalidated if used on a different device or network.
- **Anti-Export & Screenshot Security** — If a user is restricted from exporting, the UI activates robust deterrence: text selection and right-clicking are disabled, Developer Tools are trapped, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, F12, Snipping Tool) are blocked, and the screen aggressively blurs to 0% opacity if the window loses focus to deter screen recording software.
- **Public REST API Gateway** — Generate secure API keys to expose aggregated data to external applications via `/api/v1/public/:collection`. Includes dynamic filtering, pagination, MongoDB query translation, and highly granular rate limiting (per second/minute/hour) and usage quotas (per day/week/month).
- **Activity & IP Auditing** — Comprehensive user activity logs with automatic IP Geolocation (`ip-api.com`), tracking ISPs, Cities, and Device information. All API requests to third-party IP services are strictly proxied through the Node.js backend to bypass aggressive browser CORS and CSP restrictions.
- **Frappe UI "Espresso" Aesthetic** — Sleek, flat design layout natively built in React + Tailwind.
- **Global Light/Dark Mode** — Fully responsive theme switching that persists in local storage.
- **Local Auth & Root Admin Protection** — Simple session-based login (no external auth service required). The primary Admin account's credentials are strictly enforced via the `.env` file, meaning the root password bypasses the database and cannot be tampered with or locked out via the UI.

## Why Use ThiruXDB? (Use Cases)

ThiruXDB is designed to solve a very specific problem: **Consolidating scattered data from dozens of different REST APIs into a single, highly searchable MongoDB database without writing custom scripts for every integration.**

### Who is this for?
- **Data Analysts & Scientists:** Who need to pull massive amounts of data from third-party APIs (like weather data, financial stocks, or sports statistics) into a database for analysis, without needing to write Node.js or Python scraper scripts.
- **Backend Developers:** Who are migrating legacy systems or aggregating data from microservices and need a reliable, fault-tolerant background engine to sync the data without building custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines from scratch.
- **OSINT Researchers:** Who need to continuously poll public APIs, handle rate limits, and map varying JSON structures into a unified format for investigation.
- **Agencies & Freelancers:** Who want to hand off a beautiful, permission-controlled, white-labeled dashboard to clients so they can browse aggregated data and export it to CSV.

### Why should you use it?
1. **No More One-Off Scripts:** Stop writing brittle `fetch()` loops in Python or Node.js every time you need to pull data from a new API. Just paste the URL into ThiruXDB, map the fields, and click fetch.
2. **Built-in Fault Tolerance:** Writing a script to download 10,000 items is hard because networks fail. ThiruXDB automatically handles connection drops, skips malformed data, and lets you safely pause/resume massive sync operations.
3. **Instant Admin Panel:** Getting data into a database is only half the battle. ThiruXDB instantly gives you and your team a lightning-fast, searchable frontend to actually *look* at the data you just downloaded.
4. **Public REST API Gateway:** Turn ThiruXDB into your organization's central Data Hub. Securely distribute aggregated data to your external apps or third-party clients via API Keys and `GET /api/v1/public/...` endpoints, complete with built-in pagination, filtering, and API Rate Limits to prevent abuse.
5. **Military-Grade Security:** With built-in RBAC, JWT fingerprinting, dynamic cryptographic keys, and anti-export protections, you can safely give external clients or junior employees access to view the data without worrying about them deleting it, stealing it, or hijacking sessions.

## Deployment

ThiruXDB can be easily deployed to modern serverless and PaaS platforms. Below are the recommended deployment strategies, ranging from Serverless functions to Persistent Docker environments.

### Persistent Servers (Render, Railway, VPS) [Recommended]

For production environments handling continuous background syncs, **Persistent Servers** are highly recommended. Unlike Serverless, persistent servers do not sleep between requests, allowing ThiruXDB's internal `setInterval` sync engine to run reliably.

- **[Render.com](https://render.com/) / [Railway.app](https://railway.app/)**
  - **Build Command:** `bun run build`
  - **Start Command:** `bun run start` (or `node server/index.js`)
  - *Note: ThiruXDB includes a built-in Anti-Sleep mechanism specifically designed for Render's Free Tier! It will automatically self-ping every 14 minutes to prevent your backend from sleeping during long background syncs.*
- **VPS / Docker (DigitalOcean, AWS, Linode)**
  - Run via `pm2 start server/index.js` or build the included Dockerfile.

### Vercel / Netlify (Serverless)

ThiruXDB is natively configured to run on Serverless platforms like Vercel and Netlify out of the box! The repository includes a `vercel.json` config and an `api/index.js` serverless endpoint that perfectly bridges the Express backend with Vercel's Node.js runtime.

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel or Netlify.
2. Set your **Environment Variables** (`MONGODB_URI`, `VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `VITE_ADMIN_PASS`).
3. Deploy! The platform will automatically build the React frontend and configure the Serverless API endpoints.

> **Note on Serverless Syncing:** Because serverless functions spin down after responding to a request, ThiruXDB's internal background sync engine will only trigger when the API is actively receiving traffic. For strict cron-based syncing, a persistent server is required.

### Why no Cloudflare Workers support?

Currently, ThiruXDB cannot be deployed directly to Cloudflare Workers or Cloudflare Pages Functions. This limitation stems from the **MongoDB Node.js Driver** relying heavily on native Node.js core modules (such as `net`, `tls`, `dns`, and `crypto`) to establish binary TCP connections, which Cloudflare's V8 Isolates do not fully support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) `>= 1.0`
- A MongoDB instance — [MongoDB Atlas free tier](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) works great

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThiruXD/Endpoint-URL-Migration-To-MongoDB.git
cd Endpoint-URL-Migration-To-MongoDB
bun install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB=thiruXDB
PORT=3001
VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username_here
VITE_ADMIN_PASS=your_password_here
```

> **Note:** Bun loads `.env` automatically — no `dotenv` package required.

### 3. Run in Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts both servers concurrently:
- **Vite** (frontend) → `http://localhost:5173`
- **Express API** → `http://localhost:3001`

Vite proxies all `/api/*` requests to the Express server, so the frontend just calls `/api/...`.

### 4. Login

Default credentials (change in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Username | `your_username` |
| Password | `your_password` |
